# Hello cairo plugin

The repository demonstrates the usage of cairo plugin system. It contains the plugin which for each function annotated with `hello` attribute prints `Hello, <function-name>!`.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

Setup the cairo environment with the `asdf install` command.

### Usage

To use the plugin in your project annotate a function with `hello` attribute:

```
#[hello]
fn multiply(a: u8, b: u8) -> u8 {
    a * b
}
```

An example project is located in [example directory](./example/).

### Execution

2. cd into example directory:

```
cd example/
```

2. Run the plugin to compile project:

```
cargo run build .
```

3. Run compiled code:

```
scarb cairo-run --no-build
```

4. You should see the output:

```

## Project structure

The package consists of two parts: business logic and boilerplate code. Boilerplate code is stored in `src/main.rs` and `src/boilerplate` directory. Business logic is stored in `src/plugin`.
Plugin directory contains three files:

- `config.rs` contains base properties of the plugin - its name, version and repository URL.
- `macro_plugin.rs` contains the plugin configuration. This is the place where you map item type to the function that processes it.
- `insert_hello.rs` contains the function that inserts hello message.
